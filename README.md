# Unscented-Kalman-Filter

In this project, I have implemented a unscented kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases">here</a>.

__To build the project run the following commands:__
1. `cd ./build`
2. `make`

Run `./UnscentedKF` to run.
